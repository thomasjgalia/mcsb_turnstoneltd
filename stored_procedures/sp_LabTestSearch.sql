-- Stored Procedure: sp_LabTestSearch
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Search for lab tests in the Measurement domain
-- Performance: Query plan cached by SQL Server for faster compilation
-- Parameters:
--   @SearchTerm - Search term to match against concept ID, code, or name
-- Returns: Lab test search results with property, scale, system, time, and panel count
-- ============================================================================
